# Authentication & Authorization System using FastAPI

This project is a clean and extensible authentication & authorization API built with **FastAPI** and **SQLModel**, using **JWT tokens**, **Redis** blocklist, and **SQLite** (or any SQL backend).

- ✅ Secure token revocation via Redis blocklist (`/logout`)
- ✅ Token renewal (`/refresh`)
- ✅ Password hashing (via `passlib`)
- ✅ Pydantic validation and error handling
-  Test coverage using `pytest`, `httpx`, and `fakeredis` (IN PROCESS)
- ✅ Docker support
